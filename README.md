# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data_Assignment2
The only script is run_analysis.R

The only thing required is a folder called DATA in the same directory as the run_analysis.R and it needs to contain whatever is extracted from file "getdata_projectfiles_UCI HAR Dataset.zip". I.e. it is best to rename the folder created by the .zip file to /DATA. Then the script should work.

The script needs the reshape2 library but there is code in there to automatically install and load the package :)
